# Data analysis project

Our project is titled "GDP and population" and is about the link between wealth and population size. The project contains data on GDP per capita and population size for 188 countries covering a 30-year period from 1990 to today. The data used for this project originates from Oxfordeconomics.com, from which two sets of data have been extracted: (1) Data on GDP per capita in constant USD (2015 prices) and (2) data on population size. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. GDP per cap.xlsx 
2. POP.xlsx 

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

1. Pandas
2. matplotlib.pyplot
3. ipywidgets
4. Numpy
