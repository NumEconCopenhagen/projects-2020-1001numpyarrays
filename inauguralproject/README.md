# Inaugural project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

We attempt to solve a labor supply problem using the optimize tool from the scipy-kit. Furthermore we use the matplotlib library to illustrate our findings, using a for loop, to determine whether they are economically reasonable. Lastly, we attempt to maximize the total tax revnue using another scipy optimizer

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
