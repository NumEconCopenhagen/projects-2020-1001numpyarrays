# Model analysis project

Our project is titled "The Basic Solow Model and COVID-19" and is about the basic Solow model and how this can be expanded to understand the current economic enviroment and consequences of the corona-virus epidemic. We start by setting up, solving, and graphing key properties of the basic Solow model before we expend the model to contain both a short and a long term damage to output caused by the spread of Covid-19.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:


1. matplotlib.pyplot
2. ipywidgets
3. Numpy 
4. Sympy
